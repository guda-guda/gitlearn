Git is a version control system.
Git is free software.
Using git to add files needs two steps:git add & git commit.
git add can just add one file once a time.but git commit can add many files a time.
Using git status can check out the content in the file if the content is change or not.
Using git diff to figure out what changes hanpend.
Using git log to show each change and the change message in each time.
Git has a mutable index called stage,which is the git add submmit place.
Using "git reset -- [options] numbers" to reset the present library version.The [options] can be "hard","soft","mixed".
Numbers is the only ID for the version you want to reset.
Using "git checkout -- "filename"" can reset the content that you add but doesn't commit or the content that you doesn't add.
Using "git reset HEAD "filename""  can cancel the contetnt to the work place that you add to the stage but doesn't commit.
AKA unstage.
